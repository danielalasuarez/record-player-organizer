# record-player-organizer
This app makes it easy to keep track and organize your record collection. When the user logs is their own personal record collection is displayed. otherwise they are directed to a default example record collection. The app also has a "Ready To Ship" option in order to keep track of records they are willing to trade/sell.

Used Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS to create this app. This app is hosted with Heroku.

Some issues I had include not being able to remove the default teal styling on my forms since I used materialize and I had problems with my GitHub SSH key. I lost most of my commits and had to delete the original repo. I went ahead and created an new one and pushed up using HTTP. (still having issues with SHH key) 
My goal with this app is to incorporate the DISCOGS API in order to make adding a record to the collection easier for the user and to incorporate a websocket for users to chat about specific records they are willing to trade/sell. I also would like to allow the user to organize their records by genre.Lastly, I would also like to fix the formatting on the home page and add some media queries in order for the background image to stop resizing.
